R Code: Recency, Frequency and Monetary Segmentation and Customer Life Time Value 

Module 1 : Statistical segmentation

In this module, you will learn the inner workings of statistical segmentation, how to compute statistical indicators about customers such as recency or frequency, and how to identify homogeneous groups of customers within a database. 

Hierarchical segmentation
Selecting the "right" number of segments
Segmentation variables
Recency, frequency, and monetary value
Computing recency, frequency and monetary value with R (Recital 1)
Data transformation
Preparing and transforming your data in R (Recital 2)
Running a hierarchical segmentation in R (Recital 3)

Module 2 : Managerial segmentation

In this module, you will learn to perform managerial segmentations, which are not built upon statistical techniques, but are an essential addition. 

Limitations of statistical segmentation
Developing a managerial segmentation
Coding a managerial segmentation in R (Recital 1)
Describing segments
Segmenting a database retrospectively in R (Recital 2)
Segments and revenue generation
R tutorial (Recital 3)

Module 3 : Targeting and scoring models

In this module, you will learn how to use R to execute lifetime value analyses. You will learn to estimate what is called a transition matrix -which measures how customers transition from one segment to another- and use that information to make invaluable predictions about how a customer database is likely to evolve over the next few years, and how much money it should be worth.
